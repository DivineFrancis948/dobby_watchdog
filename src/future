Deploying as a Service (Auto-Restart Setup)
Linux (systemd):

Create a service file (e.g., /etc/systemd/system/tauri-watchdog.service) that runs your executable.

Configure options like Restart=always and RestartSec=3 so that the systemd manager restarts the watchdog if it fails.

Test by enabling and starting the service.

macOS (launchd):

Create a plist file (e.g., ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.yourcompany.watchdog.plist) with keys like KeepAlive and RunAtLoad.

Load it using launchctl load.

Windows (Task Scheduler):

Create a scheduled task using schtasks /Create with a repeating trigger to run your watchdog executable with highest privileges.

schtasks /Create /TN "TauriWatchdog" /TR "C:\Users\user\Downloads\__MACOSX\Dobby for windows\dobby_watchdog\target\debug\dobby_watchdog.exe" /SC ONSTART /RU SYSTEM /RL HIGHEST /F

powershell
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute "C:\path\to\watchdog.exe"
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -AtStartup
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "SYSTEM" -RunLevel Highest
Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "TauriWatchdog" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Principal $principal -Force
